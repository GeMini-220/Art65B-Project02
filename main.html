                <p clss="about-us-text">The California collegiate taiko community is a vibrant network 
                    of student-led ensembles dedicated to the dynamic art of Japanese drumming. 
                    Since the formation of Kyodo Taiko at UCLA in 1990—the first collegiate taiko 
                    group in North America—this community has flourished, encompassing groups like 
                    Jodaiko at UC Irvine, Cal Raijin Taiko at UC Berkeley, and Kazan Taiko at USC. 
                    These ensembles not only perform but also serve as cultural ambassadors, 
                    promoting Japanese-American heritage through rhythm and movement.
                    </br></br>
                    A cornerstone of this community is the Intercollegiate Taiko Invitational (ITI), 
                    first hosted in 1995. This annual gathering brings together collegiate 
                    taiko groups from across the country for workshops, performances, and cultural exchange, 
                    fostering collaboration and unity . Events like the Collegiate Taiko Intensive, 
                    organized by San Jose Taiko, further enrich this community by offering immersive 
                    experiences in taiko instruction and performance .
                    </br></br>
                    Our mission is to celebrate and support this thriving community by providing 
                    a platform for connection, resource sharing, and cultural appreciation. 
                    Through this website, we aim to amplify the voices of collegiate taiko groups, 
                    share their stories, and promote the enduring legacy of taiko in California and beyond.</p>
